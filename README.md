# AI Realtor Agent Prototype

This project is a prototype of an AI Realtor Agent, built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini models. This repo is designed to serve as an example of how to reliably create an ADK agent in one easy step.

## Overview

The architecture and specifications for this agent was laid out in a design document generated by Gemini. Based on that design, a detailed implementation plan was created. This plan required some modifications to specify the correct and most up-to-date libraries for the project.

The `llms-full.txt` file, originally sourced from the [ADK Python repository](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/llms-full.txt), was found to be out of date. All the model names within this file were updated to reflect the latest available models.

## Prerequisites

This project utilizes custom commands from the [Gemini CLI Extensions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/serverless-production-readiness-java-gcp/tree/main/genai/gemini-cli-extensions) project. Specifically, it uses the `/plan` command, which allows for the definition and execution of complex, multi-step tasks.

## Quick Start

With the prerequisites in place, you can build the initial prototype of the AI Realtor Agent by executing the pre-defined plan.

From the head of this codebase, run the following command in your Gemini CLI environment:

```
/plan:impl build the ai_realtor_agent
```

This command will execute the plan located in `plans/ai_realtor_agent.md` and build the agent in approximately 2 minutes.
